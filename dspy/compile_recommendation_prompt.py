"""Offline DSPy compile step for marola's "why is this the best hour" summary.

DSPy is Python-only (no JVM port exists — see docs/FUTURE-WORK.md §10 for the Scala-ecosystem gap
and the proposed `ds4s` port) and its optimizer is a compile-time step, not a runtime dependency, so
it runs here, once, against a real LLM, and writes out a small JSON artifact (instructions + few-shot
demos) — not model weights, just an optimized prompt. The Kyo/Scala service (`core/src/main/scala`,
`marola.llm.CompiledPrompt`) loads that artifact and replays it through the same model at request
time via a plain structured-output call, with no Python in the runtime path — see
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §5a.

NOT RUN as part of writing this: it calls a real LLM repeatedly to bootstrap few-shot demos, so it
costs real (if small) money and does nothing useful against a missing/fake API key. Point
`MAROLA_DSPY_MODEL` at whichever model marola will actually run at request time — likely
the same Azure Foundry deployment `FOUNDRY_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT` names elsewhere in this repo — so the
optimized prompt matches the model that'll replay it; plain OpenAI works fine too for local
experimentation before Foundry is provisioned.

Usage:
    cd dspy
    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Plain OpenAI (quickest to try locally):
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    python compile_recommendation_prompt.py

    # Azure OpenAI / Foundry instead (DSPy uses LiteLLM under the hood —
    # https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/azure — these are LiteLLM's env
    # var names, not this repo's usual FOUNDRY_* ones):
    export AZURE_API_KEY=...

    export AZURE_API_VERSION=2026-01-01-preview
    export MAROLA_DSPY_MODEL=azure/<your-deployment-name>
    python compile_recommendation_prompt.py

    # Optional: trace every LLM call this script makes to Langfuse
    # (https://langfuse.com) — see _init_langfuse_tracing()'s docstring for why that's
    # specifically useful for a DSPy optimizer run. Omit these entirely to skip tracing.
